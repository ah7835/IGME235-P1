        <h1>P1 - Documentation</h1>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>To showcase the work as much as possible. I wanted to make the work the center piece of the portfolio. <br>
            My audience are recruiters with bust schedules. I want to make it as easy as possible for them to find my work. <br>
            <br>
            The work will be the biggest thing on the screen. I want to make the thumbnails 100% of the width of the viewport if possible.
